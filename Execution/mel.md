'mel': "Melanoma (most dangerous type of skin cancer)"
Melanoma is a malignant tumor arising from melanocytes—the pigment‑producing cells in the skin—and, while it represents only about 1% of all skin cancers, it causes the majority of skin‑cancer–related deaths due to its high propensity to invade and metastasize.  In the United States, melanoma incidence has been rising over recent decades, with an estimated 99,780 new cases expected in 2025, though advances in early detection and treatment have helped improve overall survival rates.

**Key Risk Factors**  
- **Ultraviolet (UV) exposure**: Intermittent intense sun exposure, particularly leading to sunburns, is the strongest modifiable risk factor, as UV rays directly damage DNA in skin cells.  
- **Phenotypic traits**: Fair skin, light hair/eye color, and the presence of numerous or atypical moles increase susceptibility.  
- **Genetic predisposition**: A family history—especially inherited mutations in CDKN2A, CDK4 or BAP1—and personal history of melanoma or other skin cancers elevate risk.  
- **Other factors**: Immunosuppression (e.g., organ transplant recipients), older age, male sex, and rare conditions like xeroderma pigmentosum also contribute.  

**Clinical Presentation & the “ABCDE” Rule**  
Melanomas most often develop on sun‑exposed areas but can appear anywhere, including under nails or on mucous membranes. Patients and clinicians use the ABCDE mnemonic to screen lesions:  
- **A**symmetry: one half unlike the other  
- **B**order irregularity: scalloped or poorly defined edges  
- **C**olor variation: shades of tan, brown, black—and sometimes white, red, or blue  
- **D**iameter: greater than 6 mm (about the size of a pencil eraser)  
- **E**volving: any change in size, shape, color or symptoms (itching, bleeding).  

**Diagnosis & Staging**  
Definitive diagnosis requires a skin biopsy (excisional or punch) with histopathologic evaluation. Once melanoma is confirmed, staging follows the AJCC TNM system, incorporating:  
1. **Tumor thickness and ulceration** (Breslow depth)  
2. **Regional lymph node involvement** (clinical/biopsy confirmation)  
3. **Distant metastases** (imaging, biopsy) citeturn0search8turn0search5.  
The SEER‑based 5‑year relative survival rates by stage are:  
- **Localized**: > 99%  
- **Regional**: ~ 75%  
- **Distant**: ~ 35%  
- **All stages combined**: ~ 94%.  

**Treatment Options**  
- **Early‑stage (I–II)**: Wide local excision with margins tailored to tumor thickness; sentinel lymph node biopsy for tumors ≥ 0.8 mm or with high‑risk features; adjuvant immunotherapy (e.g., pembrolizumab) for select high‑risk cases.  
- **Regional (III)**: Completion lymph node dissection or nodal observation plus adjuvant checkpoint inhibitors (anti‑PD‑1) or targeted therapy if BRAF‑mutant.  
- **Metastatic (IV)**: Systemic therapies (checkpoint inhibitors, BRAF/MEK inhibitors), sometimes in combination with surgery or radiation for oligometastatic disease.  

**Prevention & Surveillance**  
Primary prevention emphasizes sun‑safe behaviors—regular use of broad‑spectrum SPF 30+, protective clothing, avoidance of tanning beds, and seeking shade—alongside annual professional skin exams, with more frequent checks for high‑risk individuals.  Self–skin examinations monthly can facilitate early detection.  Survivors require lifelong dermatologic follow‑up to monitor for recurrence or second primaries, following guidelines from the American Cancer Society and NCCN.
