Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common form of skin cancer, arising from the basal cells in the lowest layer of the epidermis. Although it rarely metastasizes, its local invasiveness can lead to significant tissue destruction if left untreated. Below is an overview of its key aspects:

---

## 1. Epidemiology  
- **Incidence**: BCC accounts for approximately 80% of non‐melanoma skin cancers.  
- **Age & Sex**: Most commonly seen in people aged over 50, though younger patients are increasingly affected. Slight male predominance in many populations.  
- **Geography & Skin Type**: Higher rates in fair-skinned individuals and in regions with intense ultraviolet (UV) exposure (e.g., Australia, southern USA).

## 2. Etiology & Risk Factors  
- **Ultraviolet Radiation**: Cumulative UVB exposure (sunlight, tanning beds) is the primary driver.  
- **Phenotype**: Fitzpatrick skin types I–II (fair skin, light hair, freckling).  
- **Genetic Syndromes**: Gorlin syndrome (nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome) predisposes to early and multiple BCCs via PTCH1 mutations.  
- **Immunosuppression**: Organ transplant recipients and HIV-positive patients have elevated risk.  
- **Ionizing Radiation & Carcinogens**: Prior radiotherapy sites; occupational exposure to arsenic.

## 3. Pathogenesis  
UV-induced DNA damage (e.g., thymine dimers) leads to mutations in hedgehog‐pathway components (PTCH1, SMO), causing uncontrolled basal cell proliferation. Dysregulation of this pathway underlies tumor initiation and growth.

## 4. Clinical Presentation  
- **Common Sites**: Sun‐exposed areas—face (especially nose, periorbital region), ears, scalp, neck, shoulders.  
- **Lesion Types**:  
  - **Nodular BCC**: Pearly or translucent papule/nodule with telangiectasia; may ulcerate (“rodent ulcer”).  
  - **Superficial BCC**: Erythematous, scaly plaque with rolled border; often on trunk.  
  - **Morpheaform (Sclerosing) BCC**: Scar‐like, indurated plaque with ill‐defined borders; highest recurrence risk.  
  - **Pigmented BCC**: Contains melanin; may mimic melanoma.

## 5. Diagnostic Workup  
1. **Clinical Examination**: Look for characteristic pearly edge, ulceration, telangiectasia.  
2. **Dermoscopy**: Arborizing vessels, blue-gray globules, leaf-like areas.  
3. **Skin Biopsy**:  
   - **Shave** or **punch** biopsy to confirm diagnosis and subtype.  
   - Histology reveals nests of basaloid cells with peripheral palisading.

## 6. Histological Subtypes & Prognosis  

| Subtype                | Features                                   | Recurrence Risk   |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Nodular                | Well-defined nests, peripheral palisading  | Low–moderate      |
| Superficial            | Budding strips along epidermis             | Low               |
| Morpheaform/Sclerosing | Thin strands in fibrotic stroma            | High              |
| Infiltrative           | Irregular cords invading dermis            | High              |

## 7. Treatment Modalities  
Choice depends on tumor size, location, histologic subtype, patient factors:

| Modality                          | Indications                                | Cure Rates          |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| **Surgical Excision**             | Standard for most BCCs                    | ~95% (5‑year)       |
| **Mohs Micrographic Surgery**     | High‑risk sites (face), aggressive types   | ~99% (5‑year)       |
| **Curettage & Electrodesiccation**| Small, low‑risk lesions on trunk/limbs     | ~90%                |
| **Radiation Therapy**             | Elderly, poor surgical candidates          | ~90%                |
| **Topical Therapies** (e.g., imiquimod, 5‑FU) | Superficial BCC, select cases     | 70–80%              |
| **Photodynamic Therapy**          | Superficial BCC                            | ~80%                |
| **Systemic Hedgehog Inhibitors** (e.g., vismodegib, sonidegib) | Locally advanced or metastatic BCC | Variable; significant toxicities |

## 8. Follow‑Up & Prognosis  
- **Recurrence**: Patients with one BCC have a ~40–50% risk of developing another within 5 years.  
- **Metastasis**: Extremely rare (<0.1%), but locally destructive growth can impact function and cosmesis.  
- **Surveillance**:  
  - Skin exam every 6–12 months for 5 years, then annually.  
  - Patient education on self‐skin checks and sun protection.

## 9. Prevention  
- **Sun Protection**: Broad‐spectrum sunscreen (SPF ≥30), protective clothing, avoidance of peak UV hours.  
- **Behavioral Measures**: Avoid tanning beds; regular skin check by dermatologist, especially for high‐risk individuals.  
- **Chemoprevention**: Nicotinamide (vitamin B₃) shows modest benefit in reducing new non‐melanoma skin cancers.

**Key Takeaway**: While basal cell carcinoma is typically slow‐growing and rarely life‐threatening, early recognition and appropriate management are crucial to minimize tissue destruction, optimize cosmetic outcomes, and reduce the risk of recurrence. Regular skin surveillance and sun‐protective habits remain the cornerstone of long‐term prevention.
