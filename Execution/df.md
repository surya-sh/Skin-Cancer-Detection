**Definition**  
A dermatofibroma, also known as benign fibrous histiocytoma, is a common, harmless cutaneous nodule resulting from a localized proliferation of fibroblasts and histiocytes in the dermis. These lesions are typically firm, well‑circumscribed, and slow‑growing.

**Epidemiology**  
- **Age & Sex:** Most often appears in adults between 20–50 years of age, with a slight female predominance.  
- **Location:** Commonly found on the lower legs, but can occur anywhere on the body.  
- **Prevalence:** One of the most frequent benign skin tumors encountered in dermatology clinics.

**Clinical Presentation**  
- **Appearance:**  
  - Small (usually 0.5–1.0 cm), dome‑shaped papule or nodule  
  - Color ranges from light brown to dark brown or reddish–blue  
  - Surface is often smooth and slightly elevated  
- **“Dimple” (Fitzpatrick) Sign:** Lateral compression causes a central dimpling of the lesion due to tethering of the overlying epidermis.  
- **Symptoms:** Typically asymptomatic but may be mildly itchy or tender, especially after minor trauma.

**Histopathology**  
- **Dermal Proliferation:** Spindle‑shaped fibroblasts arranged in a storiform (whorled) pattern.  
- **Overlying Epidermis:** Often hyperplastic with basal hyperpigmentation.  
- **Cells:** Mixture of fibroblasts, histiocytes, and occasionally lipid‑laden macrophages.  
- **Immunohistochemistry:**  
  - **CD34:** Negative or only weakly positive (helps distinguish from dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, which is strongly CD34 positive)  
  - **Factor XIIIa:** Positive in many dermatofibromas

**Differential Diagnosis**

| Condition                              | Key Distinguishing Features                         |
|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) | Larger, more infiltrative borders; CD34‑positive    |
| Melanocytic nevus                      | More uniform pigmentation; dermatoscopic rete‑ridge pattern |
| Neurofibroma                           | Soft, “button‑hole” invagination on palpation       |
| Epidermal inclusion cyst               | Central punctum; cystic rather than fibrous core    |

**Management**  
- **Observation:** No treatment is required for asymptomatic lesions.  
- **Excision:** Considered if the diagnosis is in doubt, if the lesion is cosmetically bothersome, or if recurrent trauma causes pain. Complete excision is usually curative, with a low recurrence rate.  
- **Other Options:** Intralesional corticosteroid injection can soften particularly fibrotic lesions, though it does not remove them.
