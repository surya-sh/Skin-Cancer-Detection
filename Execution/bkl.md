**Overview**  
Benign keratoses are a group of non‑cancerous skin lesions arising from keratinocytes (the predominant cells in the epidermis). The two most common types are:  
- **Seborrheic keratosis**: Also known as “barnacles” or “stuck‑on warts,” these lesions present as waxy, scaly plaques in colors from light tan to black. citeturn0search8  
- **Solar lentigo**: Often called age spots or sun spots, these are flat or slightly raised brown macules with sharply defined borders, caused by chronic ultraviolet (UV) exposure. citeturn0search3  

**Epidemiology**  
- Both seborrheic keratoses and solar lentigines become more prevalent with age, especially after age 50, and tend to increase in number over time. citeturn0search2turn0search3  

**Clinical Features**  
- **Seborrheic keratoses**  
  - Appear as round or oval, slightly elevated plaques with a “pasted‑on” look and a greasy or verrucous surface.  
  - Range in size from a few millimeters up to >2 cm.  
  - Colors vary widely—light tan, brown, dark brown, or black—and may occur singly or in clusters. citeturn0search1  
- **Solar lentigines**  
  - Flat or minimally raised macules, typically <5 mm but sometimes coalescing into larger patches.  
  - Uniformly pigmented from light brown to dark brown, found on sun‑exposed areas (face, hands, shoulders).  
  - Do not fade with reduced sun exposure (e.g., in winter). citeturn0search3  

**Diagnosis**  
- Primarily clinical, based on characteristic appearance.  
- Dermoscopy of seborrheic keratoses often reveals keratin-filled cysts (“comedo‑like openings”) and milia‑like cysts.  
- Biopsy is performed if lesions have atypical features or to definitively rule out melanoma or other malignancies. citeturn0search0turn1image0  

**Differential Diagnosis**  
- **Actinic keratosis** (precancerous, rough scaly lesions)  
- **Common warts** (HPV‑induced papules)  
- **Melanoma** (irregular pigment, asymmetry)  
- **Basal cell carcinoma** (pearly nodules, telangiectasia) citeturn0search7  

**Management**  
- No treatment is required unless lesions are bothersome or for cosmetic reasons.  
- Common removal methods:  
  - **Cryotherapy** (liquid nitrogen)  
  - **Curettage and electrodesiccation**  
  - **Laser therapy** or **chemical peels**  
- Most techniques yield minimal scarring when performed correctly; hypopigmentation is a potential side effect. citeturn0search0  

**Prognosis**  
- Excellent—benign keratoses do not turn into cancer.  
- New lesions may continue to appear with aging and ongoing sun exposure.  
- Regular skin checks are recommended to monitor all pigmented lesions.
