**Definition and Pathophysiology**

A melanocytic nevus (American spelling “nevus”), commonly known as a mole, is a benign cutaneous lesion characterized by a localized proliferation of melanocytes, the pigment-producing cells in the skin. These lesions contain melanin and typically appear as brown or black macules or papules. Acquired melanocytic nevi often arise following childhood sun exposure and are initiated by activating mutations in the BRAF gene (most commonly V600E), leading to clonal expansion of melanocytes within the epidermis and dermis.

**Epidemiology**

Melanocytic nevi are among the most common skin lesions, with individuals typically developing between 10 and 40 moles over their lifetime; the number often peaks in the third decade of life before slowly declining with age citeturn0search10. They are more prevalent in individuals with lighter skin phenotypes and in those with significant intermittent sun exposure during childhood and adolescence.

**Clinical Features**

Clinically, benign melanocytic nevi present as well‑circumscribed, round or oval lesions ranging from 2 to 6 millimeters in diameter, though sizes can vary; they may be flat (macular), slightly elevated (papular), or dome-shaped, and sometimes contain hairs citeturn0search10. The color is typically uniform, varying from tan to dark brown or black, and the surface texture may be smooth, papillomatous, or pedunculated, especially in intradermal nevi.

**Histopathology**

Histologically, junctional nevi exhibit nests of melanocytes confined to the dermoepidermal junction, intradermal nevi show nests solely within the dermis, and compound nevi have features of both, with melanocytic nests in the epidermis and dermis citeturn0search10turn0search2. The cells are uniform, without significant atypia, and lack the architectural and cytologic features of melanoma.

**Variants and Classification**

Nevi can be congenital (present at birth or emerging shortly thereafter) or acquired (developing in childhood/adolescence) citeturn0search4. Atypical or dysplastic nevi display architectural disorder and cytologic atypia but are benign; they serve as markers for increased melanoma risk, particularly when multiple or familial.

**Malignant Potential and Surveillance**

Although most melanocytic nevi remain benign lifelong, the lifetime risk of malignant transformation for an individual nevus is estimated at approximately 1 in 3,000 for men and 1 in 11,000 for women citeturn0search10. The ABCDE criteria—Asymmetry, Border irregularity, Color variation, Diameter >6 mm, and Evolution over time—guide clinical evaluation; any lesion exhibiting these features warrants further assessment.

**Management**

Routine management of benign nevi involves education on sun protection and periodic skin self‑examinations. Dermoscopy enhances diagnostic accuracy by revealing characteristic pigment patterns and symmetry in benign nevi, reducing unnecessary biopsies citeturn0search6turn0search1. Excisional biopsy with histologic evaluation is indicated for lesions with suspicious changes or patient preference for removal.
