Benign vascular lesions of the skin and soft tissues are a heterogeneous group of disorders arising from blood‐vessel components.  The current internationally accepted framework (the ISSVA classification) divides them into two broad categories: **vascular tumors** (true proliferations of endothelial cells) and **vascular malformations** (structural vessel abnormalities without endothelial hyperplasia) .

### 1. Vascular Tumors  
These are neoplastic lesions characterized by endothelial cell proliferation.  
- **Infantile hemangioma**:  
  - The most common benign vascular tumor, appearing shortly after birth in ~4–5% of infants .  
  - Follows a rapid proliferative phase (first 6–12 months) then slow involution over years.  
  - Often superficial (“strawberry”), deep, or mixed.  
  - First‐line treatment for problematic lesions (ulceration, obstruction, cosmetic) is oral propranolol; laser and surgery are reserved for residual fibrofatty tissue or complications.  
- **Congenital hemangiomas** (rapidly involuting [RICH] or non‑involuting [NICH])  
- **Other benign vascular neoplasms**: tufted angioma, spindle‑cell hemangioma, epithelioid hemangioma.

*Histology*: lobular aggregates of capillary‑ or cavernous‑type vessels lined by plump endothelium; mitoses may be present in the proliferative phase .

### 2. Vascular Malformations  
Present at birth (though often not clinically evident until later), grow proportionally with the child, and never involute.  Classified by vessel type and flow characteristics:

| Type                             | Flow    | Clinical Features                                                                                                                                       |
|----------------------------------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Capillary malformation**       | Low     | “Port‑wine stain” — pink to purple patch; may thicken/hypertrophy over time; risk of Sturge–Weber syndrome when on trigeminal distribution.              |
| **Venous malformation**          | Low     | Soft, compressible, bluish masses; can fill with Valsalva; may contain phleboliths; pain and bleeding common.                                          |
| **Lymphatic malformation**       | Low     | Microcystic (mild swelling) or macrocystic (cystic hygroma); risk of infection, bleeding.                                                              |
| **Arteriovenous malformation**   | High    | Warm, pulsatile lesion with bruit; risk of ulceration, high‑output cardiac failure.                                                                     |
| **Combined malformations**       | Low/High| e.g. capillary‑venous, capillary‑lymphatic, capillary‑venous‑arteriovenous.                                                                            |

*Diagnosis*: clinical exam, Doppler ultrasound (flow characterization), MRI (extent, involvement), sometimes biopsy.  
*Management*:  
- **Observation** for asymptomatic low‑flow lesions.  
- **Sclerotherapy** for venous/lymphatic malformations.  
- **Pulsed‑dye laser** for capillary malformations (especially port‑wine stains).  
- **Embolization** ± surgical resection for AVMs.

### 3. Acquired Vascular Lesions  
Not present at birth; develop later in life:  
- **Cherry angiomas** (senile angiomas): common small red papules in adults > 30 years; benign, often removed for cosmetic reasons .  
- **Spider angiomas**, **pyogenic granulomas**, **nevus araneus**.

### Summary  
Benign vascular lesions encompass a spectrum from self‑resolving infantile hemangiomas to permanent malformations that may require lifelong management.  Classification by the ISSVA system guides both diagnosis and treatment planning, emphasizing lesion biology (tumor vs malformation) and hemodynamic flow characteristics .
