## System Overview

### Existing System

Traditional skin cancer screening relies on in-person consultations with dermatologists who examine lesions visually and recommend biopsies for confirmation. Some earlier automated systems used static rule-based models or basic image processing techniques to analyze lesions. These systems were neither scalable nor accurate across different skin tones and lesion types. They also lacked adaptability and continuous learning, limiting their utility in real-world clinical scenarios. As a result, the early models had high false positive and negative rates, which could lead to misdiagnosis.

### Proposed System

The proposed system is a comprehensive AI-powered web application for automated skin cancer detection. It enables users to upload dermatoscopic images which are analyzed using an ensemble of deep learning models. These models—EfficientNetV2S, EfficientNetV2M, InceptionResNetV2, and XceptionNet—are integrated into a single architecture using an averaging ensemble method. This improves accuracy and reduces bias. A simple Gradio-based interface ensures ease of use for both clinicians and laypeople. The system processes input in real time and returns a diagnosis along with a brief description of the detected condition. This architecture supports continuous improvement by retraining with new datasets.

### Requirement Analysis

#### Software Requirements:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning
