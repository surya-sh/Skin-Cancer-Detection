## System Testing

### Testing Objective

The objective is to ensure that each component functions correctly and the system reliably classifies skin cancer types. Testing verifies that the integration between modules, the model performance, and the user interface meet the expected functionality, stability, and responsiveness.

### Types of Testing

- Unit Testing: Verifying individual functions like image preprocessing and prediction.
    
- Integration Testing: Ensuring models, preprocessing, and interface work together seamlessly.
    
- System Testing: Full end-to-end testing with real images.
    
- User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Non-technical users test the interface for ease of use and accuracy.
    

## Result Analysis

### Performance Metrics

- Accuracy: Measures overall correctness.
    
- Precision: Ratio of true positives to predicted positives.
    
- Recall: Ratio of true positives to all actual positives.
    
- F1 Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
    

### Comparison with Existing Approaches

Our ensemble model outperforms individual models, with accuracy up to 94%, compared to 88â€“91% from single models. This demonstrates the strength of combining CNNs for generalized skin lesion classification. The confusion matrix and precision-recall curves further highlight the robustness of the ensemble, especially in handling class imbalance common in medical datasets.

## Conclusion and Future Enhancements

This project presents a reliable and user-friendly web-based solution for early skin cancer detection. By leveraging an ensemble of deep learning models, it achieves high accuracy and broad applicability. In future work, the inclusion of Vision Transformers, additional datasets representing more skin tones, and multilingual support for global access can further improve the system. Other enhancements include real-time lesion segmentation, a mobile-friendly interface, integration with electronic medical records, and patient feedback loops for continual learning.
