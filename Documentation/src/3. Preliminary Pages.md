Skin cancer remains one of the fastest-growing and deadliest forms of cancer worldwide, with early detection being critical for effective treatment and patient survival. However, disparities in healthcare accessibility, especially in under-resourced regions and among diverse skin types, create significant barriers to timely diagnosis. This project proposes a deep learning-powered web application designed to assist in the classification of skin cancer from dermoscopic images, with a core emphasis on inclusivity and clinical relevance.

The application is capable of detecting and classifying seven major types of skin cancer: Actinic Keratoses (akiec), Basal Cell Carcinoma (bcc), Benign Keratosis (bkl), Melanocytic Nevi (nv), Dermatofibroma (df), Vascular Lesions (vasc), and Melanoma (mel). Leveraging the power of state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the system integrates four advanced architectures—EfficientNetV2S, EfficientNetV2M, InceptionResNetV2, and XceptionNet—for feature extraction and lesion classification. Instead of a one-size-fits-all approach, the models are used selectively, depending on the characteristics and diversity of the training datasets, allowing for nuanced performance optimization tailored to specific data distributions.

To ensure the system's robustness and adaptability, diverse datasets were utilized during training and validation, with a specific focus on representing various ethnicities, age groups, and skin tones. This enhances the system's generalization capability and addresses the issue of bias often observed in dermatological AI systems. The final application allows users—patients, clinicians, and researchers—to upload images of skin lesions through a simple web interface. The backend dynamically routes the image through the most appropriate model pipeline, returning a prediction with confidence scores for each of the seven cancer types.

This project not only pushes the boundaries of AI-assisted dermatological diagnosis but also reimagines how medical tools can serve a global, heterogeneous population. The integration of multiple models, adaptive model selection based on data, and a cloud-based deployment framework culminate in a scalable and intelligent diagnostic tool. Through this initiative, we aim to democratize access to early skin cancer detection and pave the way for future research in fair, ethical, and accessible medical AI applications.
